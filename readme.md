# competitive-programming-africa

Solutions to problems from ICPC contests, mainly West Africa national contests,
ACPC, and South Africa regional contest.

## Why this repository?

This repository was created because at the time we participated to the contests
(from 2014 to 2018), solutions were not available online or provided to the
contestants. :disappointed_relieved:

So we decided to solve as many problems as we can and publish solutions with
explanations. We hope it will be helpful to future contestants.

This repository can also serve as an archive to ICPC contests in Africa, since
it is not easy to find the problemsets of these contests. We hope this will
change in the future.

## Programming languages

Solutions will be given in C, C++, Java, and Python. Python and C++ are our
favorite languages, so most of the time, solutions will be given in those
languages.

Note that you will need to compile the C programs with the option `-std=c11`
and C++ programs with the option `-std=c++17`.

For Python, we use Python 3.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you want to share your solutions or if you have
the problemset or test data of a contest, create a merge request. :innocent:

## Disclaimer

We try our best to provide the best solutions. But most of the time,
we can only test our solutions with the sample testcases and custom
testcases. So if you find a solution that is not working or want to share an
improvement, you can create an issue.
